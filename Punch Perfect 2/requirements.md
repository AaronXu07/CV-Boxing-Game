# ü•ä Punch Perfect Web ‚Äî Project Planning Document

## Overview
**Punch Perfect Web** is the next evolution of the original **Punch Perfect** prototype ‚Äî a computer vision‚Äìbased boxing game originally developed in Python using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pygame.  
The goal of this new version is to transform the concept into a **polished, full-stack web application** built primarily with **JavaScript**, **WebGL**, and **WebRTC**, making it fully playable in the browser with no local installation required.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Modernize the tech stack:** Move from Python/OpenCV to JavaScript-based frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe.js).
- **Improve accessibility:** Enable play directly in the browser with webcam-based hand tracking.
- **Enhance visuals:** Develop an interactive, animated, and responsive UI with smooth motion and sound design.
- **Add backend features:** Track scores, player progress, and fitness data.
- **Expand gameplay:** Introduce multiple modes (Targets, Reaction, Multiplayer, Training Mode).
- **Polish for deployment:** Make the game ready for public hosting and user accounts.

## üß† System Architecture

### Frontend
**Stack:**
- **React** (UI framework)
- **TensorFlow.js / MediaPipe.js** (pose and hand tracking)
- **Three.js / Pixi.js** (for interactive visuals, optional)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **Howler.js** (sound effects)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)

**Responsibilities:**
- Access webcam feed
- Run pose detection in real-time
- Map hand movement to game interactions
- Display score, timers, and feedback
- Manage different game modes and difficulty

---

### Backend
**Stack:**
- **Node.js + Express** (API)
- **MongoDB** (player data and scores)
- **WebSockets (Socket.io)** (real-time multiplayer)
- **JWT Authentication** (secure login)

**Responsibilities:**
- Store and fetch user profiles, scores, and fitness metrics
- Handle multiplayer room management and synchronization
- Manage workout/session history

---

### Deployment
**Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Vercel or Netlify  
- **Backend:** Render / Railway / AWS  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## üïπÔ∏è Planned Game Modes

| Mode | Description | Features |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| üéØ **Targets Mode** | Punch left/right color-coded targets before time runs out | Randomized target spawns, hit feedback, accuracy % |
| ‚ö° **Reaction Mode** | React as quickly as possible when the punch indicator appears | Reaction time measurement, high score tracking |
| üë• **Fruit Ninja Mode** | Instead of cutting fruits in fruit ninja, we will punch/chop them

---

## üé® Visual & UX Design

**Goals:**
- Sleek, responsive UI inspired by modern fitness and boxing apps
- Dynamic background visuals that react to punches
- Minimal latency in video and hit detection
- Animated feedback (flash, vibration, particles on hit)

**Pages:**
1. **Home Page:** Game intro + ‚ÄúStart Game‚Äù button
2. **Mode Select Page:** Choose between game modes
3. **Game Page:** Live webcam feed, overlays, score HUD
4. **Results Page:** Stats, replay, and share options
5. **Profile Page:** View history, settings, and achievements
